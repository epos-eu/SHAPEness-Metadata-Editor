# SHAPEness Metadata Editor

The SHAPEness Metadata Editor is a Java desktop application conceived to help users creating and updating RDF metadata descriptions. It provides a rich user interface which allows users to easy populate and validate metadata, structured as graphs, against a set of SHACL constraints. The SHAPEness Metadata Editor has been developed in the framework of the European Plate Observing System (EPOS) where an extension of DCAT-AP, called EPOS-DCAT-AP, was created. As it is a SHACL-driven Metadata Editor, it is suitable for all kinds of domains or use cases which structure their knowledge by means of SHACL constraints.
